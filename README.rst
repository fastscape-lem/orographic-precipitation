The model includes airflow dynamics, condensed water advection, and downslope
evaporation. It consists of two vertically-integrated steady-state advection
equations describing: (i) the cloud water density and (ii) the hydrometeor
density. Solving these equations using Fourier transform techniques,
derives a single formula relating terrain and precipitation.

Please refer to the original manuscript of `Smith & Barstad (2004)`_ to understand
the model physics and limitations.
